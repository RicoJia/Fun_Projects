## 3D CAD Modelling
1. STL file example - https://create.arduino.cc/projecthub/danny-van-den-heuvel/6dof-robotic-arm-50eab6
2. Modelling 
    - First, obtain the STL files of major parts created by Rico Jia. Note that these STL files were created using Onshape, and some not-important details are omitted. 
    - When assembling STL models into a full 3D model of the robot, special attention should be paid to: 
        1. In general, ROS follows multiple ways to express rrotation with angles. [See here](https://www.ros.org/reps/rep-0103.html). In URDF, it's **Z-Y-X** Euler angle
