# How to deploy it

## Basic Workflow
1. Set Up VPC and VPN:
    1. Create a VPC in AWS to isolate your network from the public internet.
    2. Set up a VPN connection to your VPC. AWS offers AWS VPN, or you could set up a VPN server on an EC2 instance using software like OpenVPN.

2. Deploy Website on EC2:
    1. Launch an EC2 instance within your VPC.
    2. Deploy your website to this EC2 instance. You could do this by uploading the website files directly, or by setting up a CI/CD pipeline with a service like AWS CodePipeline or Jenkins.

3. Configure Security Groups and Network ACLs:
    1. Configure Security Groups and Network Access Control Lists (ACLs) in your VPC to ensure that only traffic from your VPN is allowed to reach your EC2 instance.

4. Access Control:
    1. For your robots and yourself to access the website, you would need to connect to the VPN, and then navigate to the website hosted on the EC2 instance within your private network.

5. DNS Configuration (Optional):
    1. Within your VPC, you could set up private DNS using Route 53 Resolver or another DNS service so that you, and your robots, can use a friendly domain name to access your control website rather than an IP address.

6. Robot Configuration:
    1. Configure your robots to connect to the VPN, and provide them with the necessary credentials or certificates they'll need to establish a secure connection.

7. Monitoring and Logging (Optional):
    1. Set up CloudWatch Logs and Metrics to monitor the health and performance of your EC2 instance, your website, and possibly your VPN connection.

8. Regular Maintenance and Updates:
    1. Ensure that your EC2 instance, web server software, and VPN server software are kept up-to-date with the latest security patches and updates.
